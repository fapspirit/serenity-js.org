# Extending Playwright Test with Serenity/JS

Serenity/JS offers excellent support for Playwright, including **Playwright Test**, **UI Mode**, **trace viewer**, and **auto-waiting locators**!
Plus, it accommodates both classic Playwright tests and Serenity/JS [Screenplay Pattern scenarios](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/),
allowing you to migrate to Screenplay gradually if you'd like.

In this article, and in **less than 5 minutes**, you'll learn how to:
- **integrate Serenity/JS** with your Playwright test suite,
- **enable Serenity BDD reports**,
- start using the **Screenplay Pattern**,
- and get started with **Playwright Test UI Mode**!

## About Serenity/JS

[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org) is an open-source framework designed to make acceptance and regression testing of complex software systems faster, more collaborative, and easier to scale.

For test suites based on [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test), Serenity/JS offers:
- [Enhanced Reporting](/handbook/reporting/) - [`@serenity-js/playwright-test`](/api/playwright-test) integration module
acts as a drop-in replacement of `@playwright/test`. This means that with a one-line code change you can make your test suite produce in-depth test execution reports, start using the Screenplay Pattern, and write multi-actor test scenarios.
- [Screenplay Pattern APIs](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/) - To make your test code portable and reusable across projects and teams,
Serenity/JS gives you an optional [web abstraction layer](/api/web) on top of the native [Playwright](/api/playwright) and [Playwright Test](/api/playwright-test) APIs.
- [Integration Libraries](/api/core/) - For test suites that follow the Screenplay Pattern,
Serenity/JS also provides optional integration libraries to help you write [API tests](/api/rest/),
[manage local servers](/api/local-server/), [perform assertions](/api/assertions/), and more!

## Creating a Playwright Test project

You can add Serenity/JS to an existing Playwright Test project, or create a new project using the [Playwright Test installation wizard](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright):

```sh npm2yarn
npm init playwright@latest
```

## Installing Serenity/JS

To install Serenity/JS from NPM, run the following command:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/core @serenity-js/web @serenity-js/playwright @serenity-js/playwright-test @serenity-js/assertions @serenity-js/console-reporter @serenity-js/serenity-bdd
```

## Configuring Serenity/JS

To enable [Serenity/JS reporting services](/handbook/reporting/), configure Playwright Test as follows:

```typescript title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'
import type { SerenityOptions } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'

export default defineConfig<SerenityOptions>({
    reporter: [
        // Serenity/JS reporting services
        [ '@serenity-js/playwright-test', {
            crew: [
                '@serenity-js/console-reporter',
                '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
                [
                    '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver',
                    { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' }
                ],
            ]
        }],

        // Any other native Playwright Test reporters
        [ 'html', { open: 'never' } ],
    ],

    use: {
        // Serenity/JS configuration options
        crew: [
            // Automatically take screenshots upon an assertion failure
            ['@serenity-js/web:Photographer', { strategy: 'TakePhotosOfFailures' }]
        ],
        defaultActorName: 'Tess',
    },

    // Other Playwright Test configuration options
});
```

## Producing extended Playwright HTML reports

Serenity/JS **automatically augments** the built-in [Playwright HTML reports](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#html-reporter)
to include information about your [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) tasks.

To use this feature, simply [start using the Screenplay Pattern APIs](/api/playwright-test) in your Playwright Test scenarios and enable
the [Playwright HTML reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#html-reporter) in your Playwright configuration.

## Using Playwright Test UI Mode

Serenity/JS supports [Playwright Test UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode), which means that all your
[Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) tasks are automatically presented in the Playwright Test UI runner.

<Figure

    img={require('@site/static/images/getting-started/serenity-js-with-playwright-test/serenity-js-playwright-ui-mode.png')}
/>

To use Playwright Test UI Mode, run the following command in your Playwright Test project:
```sh
npx playwright test --ui
```

- [Serenity/JS + Playwright Test template project](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)
- [Playwright Test UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode)

## Using Playwright Test Trace Viewer

Serenity/JS supports [Playwright Test Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro), which means that all your
[Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) tasks are automatically presented in the Trace Viewer UI.

To use this feature, simply [start using the Screenplay Pattern APIs](/api/playwright-test) in your Playwright Test scenarios and enable
tracing in [Playwright Test configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

<Figure
    caption='Using Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern with Playwright Test Trace Viewer'

## Producing Serenity BDD reports

[Serenity reports and living documentation](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter) are a powerful feature enabled by Serenity BDD.
They aim not only to **report test results**, but also to document **how features are tested**, and **what your application does**.

Serenity BDD reports are generated by [Serenity BDD CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core/tree/main/serenity-cli),
a Java program downloaded and managed by the [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd/) module.

View [live Serenity BDD report on GitHub](https://serenity-js.github.io/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/serenity/) 👀

<Figure
    caption='Example Serenity BDD report'
    externalLink={'https://serenity-js.github.io/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/serenity/'}
    img={require('@site/static/images/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter.png')}
/>

To produce Serenity BDD reports, your test suite must:
- produce intermediate Serenity BDD `.json` reports, by registering [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter/) as per the [configuration instructions](#configuring-serenityjs)
- invoke the Serenity BDD CLI when you want to produce the report, by calling `serenity-bdd run`

The pattern used by all the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) relies
on using:
- [`npm-failsafe`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-failsafe) to run the reporting process even if the test suite itself has failed (which is precisely when you need test reports the most...).
- [`rimraf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf) as a convenience method to remove any test reports left over from the previous run

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rimraf target",
    "test": "failsafe clean test:execute test:report",
    "test:execute": "playwright test",
    "test:report": "serenity-bdd run",
  }
}
```

To learn more about the `SerenityBDDReporter`, please consult:
- installation instructions in [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd` documentation](/api/serenity-bdd/),
- configuration examples in [`SerenityBDDReporter` API docs](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter/),
- [Serenity/JS + Playwright Test project template on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)
- [Serenity/JS examples on GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples).

## Using Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern APIs

The [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/) is an innovative, user-centred approach to writing high-quality automated acceptance tests.
It steers you towards an effective use of layers of abstraction, helps your test scenarios capture the business vernacular of your domain,
and encourages good testing and software engineering habits on your team.

[`@serenity-js/playwright-test`](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright-test/) module offers [fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures)
that integrate [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) with Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern APIs.

By default, Serenity/JS configures a default [cast](/api/core/class/Cast/) of [actors](/api/core/class/Actor/),
where every actor can:
- [`BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright`](/api/playwright/class/BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright/)
- [`TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad()`](/api/core/class/TakeNotes/)

This should be enough to help you get started with introducing test scenarios that follow the Screenplay Pattern even to an existing test suite, for example:


```typescript title="specs/example.spec.ts"
// import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'          // replace this
import { test, expect } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test' // with this

import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { Ensure, matches } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

test.describe('My awesome website', () => {

    test('can have test scenarios that follow the Screenplay Pattern', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            Navigate.to(`https://playwright.dev`),
            Ensure.that(
                Page.current().title(),
                matches(/Fast and reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps.*/)
            ),
        )
    })

    test('can have non-Screenplay scenarios too', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('https://playwright.dev')
        await expect(page)
            .toHaveTitle(/Fast and reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps.*/);
    })
})
```
