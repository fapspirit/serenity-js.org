# Serenity BDD Reporter

[Serenity reports](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/the_serenity_reports) are a powerful feature enabled by Serenity BDD. They aim not only to **report test results**, but also to document **how features are tested**, and **what your application does**.
[`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd) module enables integration between Serenity/JS and the Serenity BDD reporting CLI.

**You will learn:**
- How to install Serenity BDD
- How to configure Serenity BDD reporter
- How to produce Serenity BDD reports

## Module overview

[`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd) module:
- gathers information about your test execution,
- analyses your test directory structure to understand your requirements hierarchy,
- produces Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports,
- helps you download and run [Serenity BDD CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core/tree/main/serenity-cli) - a Java program that turns the JSON reports into [HTML reports and living documentation](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/the_serenity_reports).

### Examples and Project Templates

If you'd like to dive straight into the code,
[Serenity/JS GitHub](https://github.com/serenity-js) provides:
- [Serenity/JS project templates](https://github.com/serenity-js?q=template&type=all&language=&sort=), which are the easiest way to start with the framework
- [Examples and reference implementations](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples), each set up to produce a Serenity BDD report

:::tip Example Serenity BDD reports
All the [Serenity/JS project templates](https://github.com/serenity-js?q=template&type=all&language=&sort=)
produce Serenity BDD reports and publish them to their GitHub Pages. Have a look at the example [Serenity BDD report](https://serenity-js.github.io/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template/),
generated by the [Serenity/JS + Cucumber + Playwright project template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template/).
:::

## Installation

First, install and configure a [Serenity/JS test runner adapter](/handbook/test-runners/) for your test runner of choice.

Next, add the [`@serenity-js/serenity-bdd`](/api/serenity-bdd) module to your project by running the following command in your computer terminal:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/serenity-bdd
```

If you're starting a new project or need a reference implementation,
consider using one of the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/)
as they all come with pre-configured test runner adapters and built-in support for Serenity BDD reporting.

## Configuration overview

To make your project produce Serenity BDD reports, you need to:
- use a [Serenity/JS test runner adapter](/handbook/test-runners/) to emit [domain events](/handbook/reporting/domain-events) that describe what happened during test execution,
- use the [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter) ["stage crew member"](/api/core/interface/StageCrewMember/) to translate those events into Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports,
- use the [`ArtifactArchiver`](/handbook/reporting/artifact-archiver) to store the JSON reports to disk,
- run the Serenity BDD CLI when the test run completes.

### Configuring the test runner adapter

Serenity/JS needs to know where your test scenarios are located to analyse your [requirements hierarchy](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/#the-requirements-hierarchy).
The framework automatically detects conventional locations, such as `features`,  `specs`, `spec`, `tests`, `test` or `src` subdirectories of your project.
If your project uses a different directory structure, you should configure your Serenity/JS test runner adapter
to point to your desired location by specifying the [`specDirectory`](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#Properties) property.

### Configuring the Serenity BDD reporter

To produce the Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports, your test runner adapter should use the [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter) stage crew member.
While the different test runners might have a slightly different configuration syntax,
the `SerenityBDDReporter` itself is configured in the same way across all of them.

For example, to use the `SerenityBDDReporter` with default settings, you can configure it as follows:
```ts
// ...
    crew: [
      '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
    ]
// ...
```

You can customise the behaviour of the `SerenityBDDReporter` by passing the [`SerenityBDDReporterConfig`](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/) configuration object:

```ts
// ...
    crew: [
      [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', {
          specDirectory: './spec',
          reporter: {
              includeAbilityDetails: true,
          },
      } ],
    ]
// ...
```

Check out the next section to learn [how to configure the `SerenityBDDReporter`](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/#configuring-the-test-runner)
for your test runner of choice.

### Configuring the Artifact Archiver

Lastly, to store the Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports to disk, your project needs to use the [`ArtifactArchiver`](/handbook/reporting/artifact-archiver), configured with your preferred output directory.

### Serenity/JS 2 vs Serenity/JS 3 syntax

If you have an existing project that uses the Serenity/JS 2 configuration syntax, you should update it to follow the Serenity/JS 3 convention:

```diff
- import { ArtifactArchiver } from '@serenity-js/core'
- import { SerenityBDDReporter } from '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd'

// ...
    crew: [
-     new SerenityBDDReporter(),
-     ArtifactArchiver.storingArtifactsAt('./target/site/serenity'),
+     '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
+     [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', {
+       outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity'
+     } ],
    ]
// ...
```

## Configuring the test runner

### Configuring Playwright Test

Playwright Test is configured using a file called [`playwright.config.ts`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) that defines the [`PlaywrightTestConfig`](/api/playwright-test/#PlaywrightTestConfig).

You should register [Serenity/JS test runner adapter for Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/) as a Playwright Test [`reporter`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters)
and configure it to use the [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter) and [`ArtifactArchiver`](/handbook/reporting/artifact-archiver) [stage crew members](/api/core/interface/StageCrewMember/).

If you specify the optional [`testDir`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-test-dir) property,
Serenity/JS adapter will interpret it as the root directory of your requirements hierarchy.
If you choose not to specify it, Serenity/JS will do its best to [automatically detect the requirements hierarchy](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#specDirectory).

```typescript title="playwright.config.ts"
import type { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
    testDir: './spec',                      // optional, indicates the root of your requirements hierarchy

    reporter: [
        [ '@serenity-js/playwright-test', {
            crew: [
                [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', {
                    specDirectory: './spec'
                } ],
                [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', {
                    outputDirectory: './target/site/serenity'
                } ],
            ]
        }]
    ],

    // Other configuration omitted for brevity
    // For details, see https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration
}

export default config
```

Learn more about using [Serenity/JS with Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/).

### Configuring Cucumber

Cucumber.js is configured using either the [command line arguments](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/cli.md), or a configuration file called `cucumber.js` that defines [Cucumber profiles](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/profiles.md).

When using Cucumber.js directly, that is without an additional test runner such as WebdriverIO or Protractor, you should register [Serenity/JS test runner adapter for Cucumber.js](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/) as a Cucumber.js [`formatter`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/formatters.md).
If your Cucumber `.feature` files are stored in a directory other than `features`, you should configure the [`specDirectory`](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#specDirectory) property
using [`formatOptions`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/formatters.md#options).

```js title="cucumber.js"
module.exports = {
  default: {
    format: ['@serenity-js/cucumber'],
    formatOptions: {
        specDirectory: './features'
    },
    requireModule: ['ts-node/register'],
    require: [
        './features/**/*.steps.ts',
        './features/support/*.hooks.ts',
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that Serenity/JS [stage crew members](/api/core/interface/StageCrewMember/) need to be configured programmatically
by calling the Serenity/JS [`configure`](/api/core/function/configure/) function in a Cucumber.js
[`BeforeAll` hook](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/support_files/hooks.md#beforeall--afterall).

```typescript title="features/support/hooks.ts"
import { BeforeAll } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { configure } from '@serenity-js/core'
import * as path from 'path'

BeforeAll(() => {

    // Configure Serenity/JS
    configure({
        crew: [
            [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', {
                specDirectory: path.resolve(__dirname, '..')  // optional, requirements hierarchy root
            } ],
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', {
                outputDirectory: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../target/site/serenity')
            } ],
            // ... any other reporting services
        ],
    })
})
```

Learn more about using [Serenity/JS with Cucumber.js](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/).

### Configuring Mocha

Mocha is configured using either the [command line arguments](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage),
or a [configuration file](https://mochajs.org/#configuring-mocha-nodejs), such as `.mocharc.yaml`.

When using Mocha directly, that is without an additional test runner such as WebdriverIO or Protractor, you should register [Serenity/JS test runner adapter for Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha/) as a Mocha [`reporter`](https://mochajs.org/#reporters).
If your Mocha spec files are stored in a directory other than `specs`, `spec`, `tests`, or `test`, you should configure the [`specDirectory`](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#specDirectory) property
using [`reporter-options`](https://mochajs.org/#-reporter-option-option-o-option-reporter-options-option).

```yaml title=".mocharc.yml"
reporter: '@serenity-js/mocha'
reporter-options: 'specDirectory=./specs'
require:
  - ts-node/register
  - spec/support/serenity.config.ts
```

Note that Serenity/JS [stage crew members](/api/core/interface/StageCrewMember/) need to be configured programmatically
by calling the Serenity/JS [`configure`](/api/core/function/configure/) function in a Mocha support file, such as `spec/support/serenity.config.ts`.

```typescript title="spec/support/serenity.config.ts"
import { configure } from '@serenity-js/core'
import * as path from 'path'

configure({
    crew: [
        [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', {
            specDirectory: path.resolve(__dirname, '..')  // optional, requirements hierarchy root
        } ],
        [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', {
            outputDirectory: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../target/site/serenity')
        } ],
        // ... any other reporting services
    ],
})
```

### Configuring Jasmine

While Jasmine supports configuration via a [configuration file](https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html#configuration) located at `spec/support/jasmine.json`,
any reporters need to be configured using either the [command line arguments](https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html#--reporters)
or programmatically, by calling the [`addReporter`](https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html#reporters) method of the Jasmine environment in a helper file.

If your Jasmine spec files are stored in a standard location, such as `specs`, `spec`, `tests`, or `test` subdirectory you don't need to configure anything
and can simply invoke the `jasmine` command line tool with the `--reporter` parameter:

```sh
jasmine --reporter='@serenity-js/jasmine'
```

If your spec files are stored in a non-standard location, you should register the Serenity/JS test runner adapter programmatically in a Jasmine helper file, such as `spec/helpers/serenity.reporter.ts"`:
and configure the [`specDirectory`](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#specDirectory) property to point at your desired location:

```ts title="spec/helpers/serenity.reporter.ts"
import serenityReporterForJasmine from '@serenity-js/jasmine'
import * as path from 'path'

jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(serenityReporterForJasmine({
    specDirectory: path.resolve(__dirname, '../')
}))
```

When using Jasmine directly, that is without an additional test runner such as WebdriverIO or Protractor,
Serenity/JS [stage crew members](/api/core/interface/StageCrewMember/) need to be configured programmatically
by calling the Serenity/JS [`configure`](/api/core/function/configure/) function in a Jasmine helper file.


```ts title="spec/helpers/serenity.config.ts"
import { configure } from '@serenity-js/core'
import * as path from 'path'

configure({
    crew: [
        [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', {
            specDirectory: path.resolve(__dirname, '..')  // optional, requirements hierarchy root
        } ],
        [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', {
            outputDirectory: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../target/site/serenity')
        } ],
        // ... any other reporting services
    ],
})
```

To make Jasmine load the helpers, create a `spec/support/jasmine.json` file and specify the location of the helper files.

```json title="spec/supportjasmine.json"
{
  "spec_files": [
    "**/*.spec.ts"
  ],
  "helpers": [
    "helpers/**/*.ts"
  ],
  "requires": [
    "ts-node/register"
  ]
}
```

### Configuring WebdriverIO

WebdriverIO is configured using a file called [`wdio.conf.ts`](https://webdriver.io/docs/configurationfile/) that defines the [`WebdriverIOConfig`](/api/webdriverio/interface/WebdriverIOConfig/).
You should register [Serenity/JS test runner adapter for WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio/) as a WebdriverIO [`framework`](https://webdriver.io/docs/frameworks/#using-serenityjs),
as it integrates WebdriverIO with a lower-level `runner`, such as `cucumber`, `jasmine` or `mocha`.

Serenity/JS adapter for WebdriverIO will take care of registering the Serenity/JS adapter for the lower-level runner too, so you don't need to do it yourself.
Additionally, it will allow you to pass options to the lower-level runner via `cucumberOpts`, `jasmineOpts`, or `mochaOpts` properties of the `WebdriverIOConfig` instead of the separate files
those runners normally require.

```typescript title="wdio.conf.ts"
import { WebdriverIOConfig } from '@serenity-js/webdriverio'

export const config: WebdriverIOConfig = {

    // Tell WebdriverIO to use Serenity/JS framework
    framework: '@serenity-js/webdriverio',

    // Serenity/JS configuration
    serenity: {
        // Configure Serenity/JS to use the appropriate adapter for your test runner
        runner: 'cucumber',
        // runner: 'mocha',
        // runner: 'jasmine',

        // Register Serenity/JS reporting services, a.k.a. the "stage crew"
        crew: [
            // Optional, produce Serenity BDD reports and living documentation (HTML)
            [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', { specDirectory: './specs' } ],
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
        ]
    },

    // Configure your Cucumber runner
    cucumberOpts: {
        formatOptions: {
            specDirectory: './features'                 // optional, requirements hierarchy root
        },
        // ...
    },


    // ... or Jasmine runner
    // jasmineOpts: {
    //     specDir: './specs'                           // optional, requirements hierarchy root
    // },

    // ... or Mocha runner
    // mochaOpts: {
    //     reporterOptions: {
    //         specDirectory: './specs'                 // optional, requirements hierarchy root
    //     },
    // },

    runner: 'local',

    // Any other WebdriverIO configuration
}
```

### Configuring Protractor

Protractor is configured using a file called [`protractor.conf.js`](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api-overview#example-config-file) that defines the [Protractor `Config`](/api/protractor-adapter/interface/Config/).
You should register [Serenity/JS test runner adapter for Protractor](/handbook/test-runners/protractor/) as a Protractor [`framework`](https://www.protractortest.org/#/frameworks#using-serenity-js),
as it integrates Protractor with a lower-level `runner`, such as `cucumber`, `jasmine` or `mocha`.

Serenity/JS adapter for Protractor will take care of registering the Serenity/JS adapter for the lower-level runner too, so you don't need to do it yourself.
Additionally, it will allow you to pass options to the lower-level runner via `cucumberOpts`, `jasmineOpts`, or `mochaOpts` properties of the Protractor config instead of the separate files
those runners normally require.

```js title="protractor.conf.js"
exports.config = {

    // Tell Protractor to use Serenity/JS framework
    framework:      'custom',
    frameworkPath:  require.resolve('@serenity-js/protractor/adapter'),

    // Serenity/JS configuration
    serenity: {
        // Configure Serenity/JS to use the appropriate adapter for your test runner
        runner: 'cucumber',
        // runner: 'mocha',
        // runner: 'jasmine',

        // Register Serenity/JS reporting services, a.k.a. the "stage crew"
        crew: [
            // Optional, produce Serenity BDD reports and living documentation (HTML)
            [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd', { specDirectory: './specs' } ],
            [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
        ]
    },

    // Configure your Cucumber runner
    cucumberOpts: {
        formatOptions: {
            specDirectory: './features'                 // optional, requirements hierarchy root
        },
        // ...
    },


    // ... or Jasmine runner
    // jasmineNodeOpts: {
    //     specDir: './specs'                           // optional, requirements hierarchy root
    // },

    // ... or Mocha runner
    // mochaOpts: {
    //     reporterOptions: {
    //         specDirectory: './specs'                 // optional, requirements hierarchy root
    //     },
    // },

    runner: 'local',

    // Any other WebdriverIO configuration
}
```

## Using Serenity BDD CLI

To turn the Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports produced by the `SerenityBDDReporter` into Serenity BDD test reports,
you need the [Serenity BDD reporting CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core).

The Serenity BDD reporting CLI is a Java program, distributed as an executable `.jar` file and available to download from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/net.serenity-bdd/serenity-cli).

The `@serenity-js/serenity-bdd` module ships with a command line tool called `serenity-bdd`, where:
- `serenity-bdd update` command downloads the Serenity BDD CLI `jar` and caches it locally
- `serenity-bdd run` command is a wrapper around the Serenity BDD CLI that invokes the Serenity BDD CLI `jar` to produce HTML reports based on the JSON reports generated by the `SerenityBDDReporter`

To learn more about `serenity-bdd`, run the following command in your computer terminal:

```sh
npx serenity-bdd --help
```

To produce Serenity BDD reports, your test suite must:
- use the [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter), which produces intermediate Serenity BDD `.json` reports
- call `serenity-bdd run` when the test run completes to generate the aggregated HTML report

The pattern used by all the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) relies
on using:
- [`npm-failsafe`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-failsafe) to run the reporting process even if the test suite itself has failed (which is precisely when you need test reports the most...).
- [`rimraf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf) as a convenience method to remove any test reports left over from the previous run

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rimraf target",
    "test": "failsafe clean test:execute test:report",
    "test:execute": "cucumber-js",
    "test:report": "serenity-bdd run"
  }
}
```
Note that in the above code sample, you should configure `test:execute` to invoke your [test runner](/handbook/test-runners/) of choice.

### Downloading Serenity BDD CLI

To download the Serenity BDD reporting CLI or to update it, use the `update` command:

```console
npx serenity-bdd update
```

To download Serenity BDD reporting CLI jar from your company's artifact repository, specify the `--repository` parameter:

```
npx serenity-bdd update --repository https://artifactory.example.org/
```

To learn more about the `update` command, run:

```
npx serenity-bdd --help update
```

Please note that the `update` command will try to download the `.jar` only if you don't have it cached already, or when the one you have is not up to date. Otherwise, no outbound network calls are made.

#### Downloading through a proxy

The `update` command picks up your proxy configuration automatically from your [NPM config](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-config), [`.npmrc` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc), or environment variables.
Please note that you only need to use one of those configuration mechanisms.

##### Using NPM config (Linux, macOS, Windows)

To use NPM-level configuration, run the following commands in your terminal:

```console
npm config set proxy http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
npm config set https-proxy http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

If your proxy requires a certificate file, you can provide a path to it as follows:

```console
npm config set cafile /path/to/root-ca.pem
```

The above can also be accomplished by placing an [`.npmrc` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc) with following contents in your home directory or your project root:

```bash
# ~/.npmrc
proxy = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
https-proxy = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port

cafile = /path/to/root-ca.pem          # optional
noproxy = localhost,mycompany.com      # optional
```

##### Using environment variables on Linux or macOS

To set your proxy on Linux or macOS, run the following commands in your terminal:

```console
export HTTP_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

If needed, you can also set a `NO_PROXY` variable to a comma-separated list of domains that don't require a proxy, for example:

```console
export NO_PROXY=localhost,mycompany.com
```

Please note that you can add the above commands to your shell's `~/.profile`, so that they're executed whenever you open a new terminal.

##### Using environment variables on Windows

To configure a proxy on Windows, run the following commands in Command Prompt:

```console
set HTTP_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

If you're using Powershell, run the following commands instead:

```console
$env:HTTP_PROXY = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = http://[user:pwd]@domain.tld:port
```

#### Using a specific User-Agent

If your artifact registry requires you to use a specific user agent, you can configure it using NPM config:

```console
npm config set user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0"
```

#### Ignoring SSL checks

You can instruct the `update` command to ignore any SSL certificate errors by providing an `--ignoreSSL` flag when running the command:

```console
npx serenity-bdd update --ignoreSSL
```

You can also disable certificate checks at the NPM config level by running:

```console
npm config set strict-ssl false
```

Alternative, you can accomplish the same with an `.npmrc` file:

```bash
# ~/.npmrc
npm_config_strict-ssl = false
```

### Configuring Serenity BDD CLI

To configure the [Serenity BDD reporting CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core),
place a file called [`serenity.properties`](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reference/serenity-properties)
in your project root directory. For example:

```properties title="serenity.properties"
serenity.project.name=My awesome project
```

:::tip
Please note that Serenity BDD reporting CLI considers only those properties that are related to producing test reports.
:::

#### Including Custom Fields
You can add custom fields to the overview page of the report.

### Running Serenity BDD CLI

To produce the Serenity BDD test report and living documentation using default settings, run:

```
npx serenity-bdd run
```

To learn more about the `run` command and how to change the defaults, run:

```
npx serenity-bdd --help run
```

## Serenity BDD Best Practices

While Serenity BDD generates great test reports out of the box,
by following a few simple best practices you can turn them into proper [living documentation](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation)
for your product.

In this section, we'll focus on best practices particularly relevant to Serenity/JS users.

### The requirements hierarchy

Organising your specs in a directory hierarchy is a great way to make them easier to navigate and understand.
It also allows Serenity to organise your test reports in a similar way and offer insight into what requirements
were verified at several levels of detail.
This idea is called the "requirements hierarchy" and you can learn more about it
in the [Serenity BDD documentation](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation#the-requirements-hierarchy).

#### Requirements hierarchy for Cucumber.js projects

If you're working with Cucumber.js, the root directory of the requirements hierarchy is typically called `features`
and typically contains a flat list of `.feature` files, each representing a feature of your system:

```
features
|- authentication.feature
|- shopping_cart.feature
|- checkout.feature
|- shipping.feature
...
```

While Cucumber.js doesn't recognise or enforce any particular directory structure, Serenity BDD recognises directories
as representing [various levels of the requirements hierarchy](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation#common-requirements-structures).
And so, instead of storing all the `.feature` files in a single directory, you can organise them in a directory hierarchy, where each directory
represents a [business capability](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/reporting/living_documentation#goals-capabilities-and-features) of your system:

```
features
|- authentication
|  |- google_sign_in.feature
|  |- microsoft_sign_in.feature
|  |- custom_single_sign-on.feature
|  \- README.md
|
|- shopping_cart
|  |- item_management.feature
|  |- save_for_later.feature
|  |- did_you_forget_something.feature
|  \- README.md
|
|- checkout
...
```

Note that in this structure, each directory contains a `README.md` file, which is a great place to document the business capability,
lint to any external documentation, architectural diagrams, and so on. Serenity BDD parses such `README.md` files and includes their contents
in the generated documentation.

For more complex systems, you can also nest the business capability directories further to group related capabilities into themes,
for example:

```
features
|- security
|  |- authentication
|  |  |- google_sign_in.feature
|  |  |- microsoft_sign_in.feature
|  |  |- custom_single_sign-on.feature
|  |  \- README.md
|  |
|  |- audit_trail
|     |- monthly_report.feature
|     |- unexpected_user_activity_alerting.feature
|     \- README.md
```

#### Requirements hierarchy for non-Cucumber.js projects

If you're using any other [supported test runner](/handbook/test-runners/), Serenity BDD will still recognise the directory structure
as the requirements hierarchy as long as you:
- name the root directory of your requirements hierarchy `spec`, `specs`, `tests`, `test` or `features`
  (or configure the [`specDirectory`](#configuring-the-test-runner) property of the `SerenityBDDReporter`
  and the `--features` parameter of `serenity-bdd run` command with a different value)
- give your spec files a suffix recognised by Serenity BDD, such as `.spec.ts`, `.e2e.js`,
  or one of the [other supported file name suffixes](/api/serenity-bdd/interface/SerenityBDDReporterConfig/#specDirectory)

For example, if you're using [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/),
[Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha/), or [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine/) you might organise your specs as follows:

```
spec
|- security
|  |- authentication
|  |  |- google_sign_in.spec.ts
|  |  |- microsoft_sign_in.spec.ts
|  |  |- custom_single_sign-on.spec.ts
|  |  \- README.md
|  |
|  |- audit_trail
|     |- monthly_report.spec.ts
|     |- unexpected_user_activity_alerting.spec.ts
|     \- README.md
```

#### Requirements hierarchy for web UI component testing projects

If you're using Serenity/JS to test [web UI components](/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/#web-component-testing), you might be following the popular convention of storing your spec files next to the component they're testing:

```
src
\- components
   |- authentication
   |  |- input-fields
   |  |  |- EmailField.ts
   |  |  |- EmailField.spec.ts
   |  |  |- PasswordField.ts
   |  |  |- PasswordField.spec.ts
   |  |  \- README.md
   |  |- LoginForm.ts
   |  |- LoginForm.spec.ts
   |  \- README.md
   |
   \- shopping_cart
```

If your UI components and their specs are stored in a top-level directory called `src`, Serenity BDD will recognise the `src` directory as the root of your requirements hierarchy and will group the specs accordingly.
If your top-level directory has a different name, you can configure the `specDirectory` property of the `SerenityBDDReporter` and the `--features` parameter of `serenity-bdd run` command with a different value.

When using the above directory structure, make sure that the outermost `describe` block in your spec files has a name matching the name of the component being tested, for example:

```typescript title="EmailField.spec.ts"
import { test as componentTest } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react'
import { useBase } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'

const { it, describe } = useBase(componentTest)

describe('EmailField', () => {

    it('allows the user to enter a valid address', async ({ actor }) => {
        // ...
    })
})
```

### File naming conventions

To help Serenity BDD correctly associate the test results with the right feature, you should keep each feature in a separate spec file,
where the name of the feature is the same as the name of the spec file.

If you're using [Cucumber.js](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/), you might have a `custom_single_sign-on.feature` file
with a matching `Feature` name:

```gherkin title="custom_single_sign-on.feature"
Feature: Custom single sign-on

  As a student
  I want to be able to sign in using my company's single sign-on solution
  So that I don't have to remember yet another password

  Scenario: Signing in with a corporate email address

    Given Alice wants to access her student account details
     When she enters her corporate email address: alice@example.org
      And completes the sign-in process using her corporate credentials
     Then she should be taken to her student account
```

For [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/),
[Mocha](/handbook/test-runners/mocha/) and [Jasmine](/handbook/test-runners/jasmine/) specs,
you might have a `custom_single_sign-on.spec.ts` file where the outermost `describe` block has a matching name:

```typescript title="custom_single_sign-on.spec.ts"
describe('Custom single sign-on', () => {

    it('allows Alice to sign in with a corporate email address', () => {
        // ...
    })
})
```

:::tip How feature name matching works?
Serenity BDD treats spaces and underscores as equivalent and performs a case-insensitive match,
so `custom_single_sign-on.feature` or `custom_single_sign-on.spec.ts`
match `Custom single sign-on` as well as `Custom Single Sign-On`.
:::

:::warning One feature, one spec file
Try to avoid having multiple top-level `describe` blocks in a single spec file, or `it`/`test` blocks without a `describe` block
as Serenity BDD will not be able to associate the test results with the right feature.

## Integration architecture

`SerenityBDDReporter` emits [`ArtifactGenerated`](/api/core-events/class/ArtifactGenerated) events containing Serenity BDD-standard JSON reports,
which can be stored to disk by [`ArtifactArchiver`](/handbook/reporting/artifact-archiver),
and then turned into Serenity BDD HTML reports by [Serenity BDD Reporting CLI](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core).
